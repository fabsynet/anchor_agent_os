<current_state>
Phase 6 execution is COMPLETE — all 4 plans executed, all 4 SUMMARYs created, verification PASSED (5/5 must-haves).

Paused DURING the execute-phase orchestrator flow, after verification but BEFORE the phase completion bookkeeping steps. The orchestrator was at step 8-11 of the execute-phase workflow.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Wave 1: 06-01 Data Foundation — Prisma schema (AgentProfile, Testimonial), shared types/schemas/constants
- Wave 2: 06-02 Backend Badge API — 9 endpoints (7 auth, 2 public), profile CRUD, testimonial submission/curation, cover photo upload
- Wave 3 (parallel): 06-03 Public Pages — /testimonial/[slug] form, /agent/[slug] badge page, middleware update
- Wave 3 (parallel): 06-04 Badge Management UI — Settings > Badge with profile editor, testimonial manager, link sharing
- Verification: 5/5 must-haves passed, VERIFICATION.md created (untracked, needs commit)
- STATE.md: Already updated by agents (shows Phase 6 complete)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

The execute-phase orchestrator needs to finish these bookkeeping steps:

1. **Update ROADMAP.md** — Mark Phase 6 as complete with date, update checkbox
2. **Update REQUIREMENTS.md** — Mark TRST-01, TRST-02, TRST-05, TRST-06, TRST-07 as "Complete"
3. **Commit phase completion** — Stage ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, VERIFICATION.md, REQUIREMENTS.md → `docs(06): complete trust-and-reputation phase`
4. **Offer next steps** — Phase 7 is next (Analytics, Import & Polish), which needs planning first

These are purely documentation/git bookkeeping — no code changes needed.
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

Key Phase 6 decisions (all documented in STATE.md):
- Badge constants inlined in API (API doesn't depend on @anchor/shared)
- Public controller without @UseGuards (separate class for unauthenticated endpoints)
- Badge-assets bucket set to public (cover photos publicly visible)
- Auto-unfeature oldest when max 2 featured reached (better UX than rejection)
- Settings sub-nav as shared component (follows expenses sub-nav pattern)
- Explicit TestimonialFormValues interface instead of z.input (Zod v4 coerce issue)
- Public pages use plain fetch, not authenticated api.ts helper
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all execution and verification complete. Only bookkeeping remains.
</blockers>

<context>
The execute-phase orchestrator (`/gsd:execute-phase 6`) was running. All 4 plans executed across 3 waves. Verification spawned and passed. The orchestrator needs to complete steps 8-11 (update roadmap, update requirements, commit, offer next).

After Phase 6 completion, Phase 7 (Analytics, Import & Polish) needs planning via `/gsd:plan-phase 7`. Phase 7 is the LAST phase — completing it means the milestone is done.

VERIFICATION.md is currently untracked (needs to be staged in the phase completion commit).
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:resume-work`. The resuming session should:

1. Read this file and STATE.md for context
2. Complete phase 6 bookkeeping:
   - Update ROADMAP.md (mark Phase 6 complete)
   - Update REQUIREMENTS.md (TRST requirements → Complete)
   - Commit: `docs(06): complete trust-and-reputation phase`
3. Present next steps (Phase 7 planning)

Alternatively, you can just run `/gsd:execute-phase 6` again — it will detect all plans have SUMMARYs and skip to verification/bookkeeping. Or manually do the bookkeeping steps.
